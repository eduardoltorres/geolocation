# Geolocation based Speedometer and Compass
To better enjoy this experience I recommend 2 options:
- run on a local server and use the External Access URL on your mobile device
- run a phone simulator (such as Xcode) on your computer and use the Exteneral Access URL on it to run the app

**Always** allow access to your location in order for the app to work properly.
